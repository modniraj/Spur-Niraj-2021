## Introduction
This guide explains how to set up and execute Selenium-based automated testing using Python. The tests are designed to interact with a specific web application, perform a series of actions, and generate a detailed HTML report using `HTMLTestRunner`.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Operating System**: This guide assumes you are using Windows, but the steps should be similar for macOS or Linux.
2. **Python**: Python 3.6 or higher should be installed on your machine.
3. **WebDriver**: Microsoft Edge WebDriver must be installed and accessible via PATH.

## Environment Setup

### 1. Install Python
- **Download**: Get the latest version of Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Install**: Follow the installation instructions, ensuring you check the option to add Python to your system PATH.

### 2. Install Required Python Packages
Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands to install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install selenium
pip install html-testRunner
```

### 3. Download and Set Up Edge WebDriver
- **Download**: Visit the [Microsoft Edge WebDriver download page](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/) and download the version that matches your installed Edge browser version.
- **Set Up**: Unzip the WebDriver and place it in a directory included in your system PATH, or specify the path directly in your scripts.

### 4. Verify Installation
Run the following command to verify that everything is set up correctly:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see the Python version. Also, test the WebDriver installation:

```bash
msedgedriver --version
```

This should print the version of the installed WebDriver.

## Project Structure

You can organize your project as follows:

```
/your-project-directory
|-- /report                 # Directory where HTML reports will be generated
|-- v1.py                 # Your main test script
|-- requirements.txt        # List of dependencies (optional)
```

The `v1.py` script contains the Selenium tests, and the `report` directory will hold the generated HTML reports.

## Understanding the Test Script

### Overview
The script `v1.py` is designed to interact with a web application hosted on a specific URL. The script performs the following steps:

1. **Navigate to the website** and wait for the page to load.
2. **Switch to the correct iframe** on the webpage.
3. **Locate and click elements** like "Testing XYZ," "Open CAPEX," and "Submit for approval" using Selenium.
4. **Capture any failures** and generate an HTML report with the status of each step.

### Structure
The script uses Pythonâ€™s `unittest` framework to structure the tests and `HTMLTestRunner` to generate an HTML report. Each significant action is encapsulated in its own test method for better modularity and error handling.

#### Example Structure:

```python
import unittest
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
import time
from HtmlTestRunner import HTMLTestRunner

class V2TestSuite(unittest.TestCase):
    # setUp method to initialize the WebDriver
    def setUp(self):
        # Setup WebDriver, maximize window, and navigate to the target URL
        pass

    # Individual test methods for each test step
    def test_step_3(self):
        pass

    def test_step_4(self):
        pass

    def test_step_5(self):
        pass

    def test_step_6(self):
        pass

    # tearDown method to close the WebDriver
    def tearDown(self):
        pass

# Run the tests with HTMLTestRunner
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main(testRunner=HTMLTestRunner(output='report', report_name='V5.1TestReport'))
```

### Key Methods:
- **`setUp(self)`**: Initializes the WebDriver and navigates to the URL.
- **`test_step_3(self)`**: Attempts to click the "Testing XYZ" element.
- **`test_step_4(self)`**: Clicks another element identified as "Testing XYZ."
- **`test_step_5(self)`**: Interacts with the "Open CAPEX" button.
- **`test_step_6(self)`**: Attempts to click the "Submit for approval" button.
- **`tearDown(self)`**: Closes the WebDriver after tests.

## Running the Tests

1. **Navigate to your project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /your-project-directory
   ```

2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python v1.py
   ```

3. **Review the Output**:
   - The tests will execute, and you'll see output in your terminal or command prompt.
   - After execution, an HTML report will be generated in the `report` directory.

## Interpreting the HTML Report

- **Location**: The HTML report will be in the `report` directory with a filename like `V5.1TestReport.html`.
- **Open the Report**: Open the HTML file in your web browser to view the test results.
- **Contents**:
  - Each test method will be listed with its status (Pass/Fail).
  - If a test failed, details about the failure, including stack trace information, will be provided.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **WebDriver Issues**: Ensure the WebDriver version matches your browser version.
2. **Element Not Found**: Increase the wait time or verify the XPath used to locate elements.
3. **Tests Always Pass/Fail**: Double-check your exception handling and ensure that exceptions are raised properly to reflect the actual test status.

### Debugging Tips:
- **Use `print` statements** in your code to output debugging information.
- **Check WebDriver Logs**: Sometimes WebDriver provides detailed logs that can help diagnose issues.
- **Run Tests Individually**: You can comment out other tests and run them one by one to isolate issues.
